# *SlugCharge*

SlugCharge was a student run project geared towards helping the homeless communit of Santa Cruz, CA. The project was led by four Electrical Engineering students at the University of California, Santa Cruz. The team aimed towards providing solar powered charging stations to the community so they can stay conencted with family and potential employers that may turn their life around!

### PCB Design

#### PCB #1
* We first started with making a testbench that was able to run our code and interact with the required I/O </br>
    Requirements:</br>
    * Utilize the **ATmega2560** as the main processor
    * Be **easliy programmable** for future code updates
    * Contain **visual annunciators** for easy state tracking 
    * Utilize **breakout pins** for off-board I/O control
    * Should **not require off-board voltage regulation**
    * Should be easily **hand assembled**
    * Restricted to a **2-layer PCB**
* The design was started off with referring to the Arduino Mega Development board and adapted to fit the required I/O:
